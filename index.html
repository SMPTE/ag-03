    <h2>Example of how to propose a new normative reference organization and/or document type</h2>

Subject: OMG

I have reviewed the materials on the OMG website for open membership, due process document
development and patent policy not unlike SMPTE. I believe they are consistent with the
requirements in our OMs for a normative reference, and I recommend we add “OMG Adopted
Specifications” to our list of approved normative references (AG-03).

For more details, the materials are publicly available here:

Organization Overview:
http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/gettingstartedindex.htm

Membership Requirements:
http://www.omg.org/memberservices/index.htm

Operational Processes:
http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/processintro.htm

Patent Policy:
http://doc.omg.org/ipr

The UML 2.2 spec (why we’re doing this):
http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.2/Infrastructure/PDF/

Note that the UML citation from SMPTE should be like any other reference citation, e.g.: “OMG
Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Infrastructure, Version 2.2, February 2009”.

As in any reference citation, a web link is useful but not required.
